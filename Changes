Version 0.05:
    - Close pipe file handles to prevent too many open files
      This fixes:
      Bug #66487: Error "Couldn't open a pipe" when more input parameters are
                  given
      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=66487
    - Fixed UNIVERSAL import warning in perl 5.12
    - Throw exception when trying to share blessed objects
      Thanks to Alexander Hartmaier <abraxxa@cpan.org>
    - Modernize tests
      Thanks to Alexander Hartmaier <abraxxa@cpan.org>
      Since, the dependency on Test::Fatal was removed
    - Converted to Module::Install
      Thanks to Alexander Hartmaier <abraxxa@cpan.org>
    - Declare that this module requires perl version 5.8 minimum, as we rely on
      Tie::ExtraHash which (apparently) was introduced in perl 5.8. Patches to
      this requirement are welcome.
    - Moved Exception POD down below general Description
Version 0.04:
    - foreach() now gives the loop correct $_ values
      This fixes:
      Bug #60384: foreach fails when @parameters doesn't use numbers
                  starting with zero
      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60384
      and
      Bug #60659: Does not work with string parameters
      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60659
    - Handle fatal errors in children e.g. if the die()
    - Detect if child didn't print any results e.g. because 'exit' was called
    - Don't allow $pl->share() to clobber any values that may already be in the
      refs - preserve the initial contents
    - Put in perldoc about two children setting same key
Version 0.03:
    - Forgot to update README
Version 0.02:
    - Renamed tieOutput to share (API change!)
