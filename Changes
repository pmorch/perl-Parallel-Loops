Version 0.04:
    - foreach() now gives the loop correct $_ values
      This fixes:
      Bug #60384: foreach fails when @parameters doesn't use numbers
                  starting with zero
      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60384
      and
      Bug #60659: Does not work with string parameters
      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60659
    - Handle fatal errors in children e.g. if the die()
    - Detect if child didn't print any results e.g. because 'exit' was called
    - Don't allow $pl->share() to clobber any values that may already be in the
      refs - preserve the initial contents
    - Put in perldoc about two children setting same key
Version 0.03:
    - Forgot to update README
Version 0.02:
    - Renamed tieOutput to share (API change!)
    - Let both while and foreach return values from the children
    - Use Storable instead of Data::Dumper
Version 0.01:
    - Initial version
