=head1 NAME

Parallel::Loops - Execute loops using parallel forked subprocesses

=encoding utf-8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Parallel::Loops;

    my $maxProcs = 5;
    my $pl = Parallel::Loops->new($maxProcs);

    my @parameters = ( 0 .. 9 );

    # We want to perform some hefty calculation for each @input and
    # store each calculation's result in %output. For that reason, we
    # "tie" %output, so that changes to %output in any child process
    # (see below) are automatically transfered and updated in the
    # parent also.

    my %returnValues;
    $pl->share( \%returnValues );

    $pl->foreach( \@parameters, sub {
        # This sub "magically" executed in parallel forked child
        # processes

        # Lets just create a simple example, but this could be a
        # massive calculation that will be parallelized, so that
        # $maxProcs different processes are calculating sqrt
        # simultaneously for different values of $_ on different CPUs

        $returnValues{$_} = sqrt($_);
    });
    foreach (@parameters) {
        printf "i: %d sqrt(i): %f\n", $_, $returnValues{$_};
    }
  
You can also use @arrays instead of %hashes, and/or while loops
instead of foreach:

    my @returnValues;
    $pl->share(\@returnValues);

    my $i = 0;
    $pl->while ( sub { $i++ < 10 }, sub {
        # This sub "magically" executed in parallel forked
        # child processes

        push @returnValues, [ $i, sqrt($i) ];
    });

And you can have both foreach and while return values so that $pl->share()
isn't required at all:

    my $maxProcs = 5;
    my $pl = Parallel::Loops->new($maxProcs);
    my %returnValues = $pl->foreach( [ 0..9 ], sub {
        # Again, this is executed in a forked child
        $_ => sqrt($_);
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Often a loop performs calculations where each iteration of the loop
does not depend on the previous iteration, and the iterations really
could be carried out in any order.

This module allows you to run such loops in parallel using all the
CPUs at your disposal.

Return values are automatically transfered from children to parents via
%hashes or @arrays, that have explicitly been configured for that sort
of sharing via $pl->share(). Hashes will transfer keys that are
set in children (but not cleared or unset), and elements that are
pushed to @arrays in children are pushed to the parent @array too (but
note that the order is not guaranteed to be the same as it would have
been if done all in one process, since there is no way of knowing
which child would finish first!)

If you can see past the slightly awkward syntax, you're basically
getting foreach and while loops that can run in parallel without
having to bother with fork, pipes, signals etc. This is all handled
for you by this module.

=head2 foreach loop

    $pl->foreach($arrayRef, $childBodySub)

Runs $childBodySub->() with $_ set foreach element in @$arrayRef, except that
$childBodySub is run in a forked child process to obtain parallelism.
Essentially, this does something conceptually similar to:

    foreach(@$arrayRef) {
        $childBodySub->();
    }

Any setting of hash keys or pushing to arrays that have been set with
$pl->share() will automagically appear in the hash or array in the parent
process.

If you like loop variables, you can run it like so:

    $pl->foreach( \@input, sub {
            my $i = $_;
            .. bla, bla, bla ... $output{$i} = sqrt($i);
        }
    );

=head2 while loop

  $pl->while($conditionSub, $childBodySub)

Essentially, this does something conceptually similar to:

  while($conditionSub->()) {
      $childBodySub->();
  }

except that $childBodySub->() is executed in a forked child process.
Return values are transfered via share() like in L</foreach loop> above.

=head3 while loops must affect condition outside $childBodySub

Note that incrementing $i in the $childBodySub like in this example
B<will not work>:

   $pl->while( sub { $i < 5 },
               sub { 
                   $output{$i} = sqrt($i);
                   # Won't work!
                   $i++ 
               }
             );

Because $childBodySub is executed in a child, and so while $i would
be incremented in the child, that change would not make it to the
parent, where $conditionSub is evaluated. The changes that make
$conditionSub return false eventually I<must> take place outside
the $childBodySub so it is executed in the parent. (Adhering to
the parallel principle that one iteration may not affect any other
iterations - including whether to run them or not) 

=head2 share

  $pl->share(\%output, \@output, ...)

Each of the arguments to share() are instrumented, so that when a
hash key is set or array element pushed in a child, this is transfered
to the parent's hash or array automatically when a child is finished.

B<Note the limitation> Only keys being set like C<$hash{'key'} = 'value'> and
arrays elements being pushed like C<push @array, 'value'> will be transfered to
the parent. Unsetting keys, or setting particluar array elements with
$array[3]='value' will be lost if done in the children. Also, if two different
children set a value for the same key, a random one of them will be seen by the
parent.

In the parent process all the %hashes and @arrays are full-fledged, and you can
use all operations.  But only these mentioned operations in the child processes
make it back to the parent.

=head3 Array element sequence not defined

Note that when using share() for @returnValue arrays, the sequence of elements
in @returnValue is not guaranteed to be the same as you'd see with a normal
sequential while or foreach loop, since the calculations are done in parallel
and the children may end in an unexpected sequence.  But if you don't really
care about the order of elements in the @returnValue array then share-ing an
array can be useful and fine.

If you need to be able to determine which iteration generated what output, use
a hash instead.

=head2 Recursive forking is possible

Note that no check is performed for recursive forking: If the main
process encouters a loop that it executes in parallel, and the
execution of the loop in child processes also encounters a parallel
loop, these will also be forked, and you'll essentially have
$maxProcs^2 running processes. It wouldn't be too hard to implement
such a check (either inside or outside this package).

=head1 Exception/Error Handling / Dying

If you want some measure of exception handling you can use eval in the child
like this:

    my %errors;
    $pl->share( \%errors );
    my %returnValues = $pl->foreach( [ 0..9 ], sub {
        # Again, this is executed in a forked child
        eval {
            die "Bogus error"
                if $_ == 3;
            $_ => sqrt($_);
        };
        if ($@) {
            $errors{$_} = $@;
        }
    });

    # Now test %errors. $errors{3} should exist as the only element

Also, be sure not to call exit() in the child. That will just exit the child
and that doesn't work. Right now, exit just makes the parent fail no-so-nicely.
Patches to this that handle exit somehow are welcome.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This module uses fork(). ithreads could have been possible too, but was not
chosen. You may want to check out:

When to use forks, when to use threads ...?
L<http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=709061>

The forks module (not used here)

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

I believe this is the only dependency that isn't part of core perl:

    use Parallel::ForkManager;

These should all be in perl's core:

    use Storable;
    use IO::Handle;
    use Tie::Array;
    use Tie::Hash;
    use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);

=head1 BUGS / ENHANCEMENTS

No bugs are known at the moment. Send any reports to peter@morch.com.

Enhancements:

Optionally prevent recursive forking: If a forked child encounters a
Parallel::Loop it should be possible to prevent that Parallel::Loop instance to
also create forks.

Determine the number of CPUs so that new()'s $maxProcs parameter can be
optional. Could use e.g. Sys::Sysconf, UNIX::Processors or Sys::CPU.

Maybe use function prototypes (see Prototypes under perldoc perlsub). 

Then we could do something like

    pl_foreach @input {
        yada($_);
    };
or

    pl_foreach $pl @input {
        yada($_);
    };

instead of

    $pl->foreach(\@input, sub {
        yada($_);
    });

and so on, where the first suggestion above means global variables (yikes!).
Unfortunately, methods aren't supported by prototypes, so this will never be
posssible:

    $pl->foreach @input {
        yada($_);
    };

An alternative pointed out by the perlmonks chatterbox could be to use
L<Devel::Declare|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Declare> "if I can stand
pain".
